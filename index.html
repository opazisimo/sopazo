				I like to design for human beings with other human beings. Empathy is my way to solve problems. I think the design is a process and I really love it. <br><br>

				During my journey at ThoughtWorks, I’ve lived some interesting things. I went to ThoughtWorks University, a training program in Pune, India where I learned about design thinking, business analysis and its relationship with the user experience’s work. After that, I went to GHC in Florida, the US, when I attend conferences and workshops related to human-centered design, human-computer interaction, and accessibility. Now I’m working as an experience designer and business analyst in a project related to gathering information about opportunities for women in technology. I enjoy being part of this. <br><br>
				I put here some projects to illustrate my design process. You can find things about the research process, testing, prototyping and visual design.
